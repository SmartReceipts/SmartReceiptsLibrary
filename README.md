Download Smart Receipts on the Google Play Store:
 
 - [Smart Receipts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wb.receipts). The free version of the app, but it also supports an in-app purchase subscription.
 - [Smart Receipts Plus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wb.receiptspro). A 'paid' app from back before Google supported in-app purchases.

The free and plus versions versions are identical, except the plus version offers the following enhancements:

- The plus version has no ads
- The plus version supports automatic backups (Android only - coming to iOS in the next update)
- The plus version automatically processes exchange rate conversions (with the newest version)

## Install 

Smart Receipts is broken into a few core modules:

* **app**. All common application code for both the `free` and `plusFlavor` flavors of the application are defined here. In practice, all development work should occur in this module  
* **wBMiniLibrary**. A few legacy items that haven't been moved into the Library module, but it's otherwise unused.

To install, clone or pull down this project. Please note that it will **NOT** work out of the box, so you will need to add the following files to ensure it will compile:
  
* `google-services.json`. This needs to be added to both the free and plus favors at the root level in order for Firebase to function. Please [refer to the Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/) for more details:
 * `app/src/free/google-services.json`
 * `app/src/plusFlavor/google-services.json`
* `app/src/main/res/values/secrets.xml`. You can copy the secrets.xml.sample file and rename the keys inside to achieve this behavior. This is used for low usage keys
* `app/src/free/res/values/ads.xml`. The ads file in smartReceiptsFree. You can add `adUnitId` and `classicAdUnitId` to enable support for AdMob Native and Classic Ads, respectively.
* `app/src/free/res/xml/analytics.xml`. The analytics file in smartReceiptsFree. You can add a key here if you wish to enable Google Analytics.

Generally speaking, it's easier to test against SmartReceiptsPlus (ie Smart Receipts PlusFlavor), since there are less secrets that have been explicitly git ignored to avoid key leaks.
